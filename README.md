# Project Portfolio Mobile Version Skeletun

>In the process of creating this portfolio website, I set up a new repository and prepared it for development using best practices (e.g. linters). I then build the mobile website using the template I choosed from figma.
I then set up the contact form and made sure that I guide the users' experience in a way that helps them fill in the form without frustration.
