# Project Portfolio Mobile Version Skeletun

>In the process of creating this portfolio website, I set up a new repository and prepared it for development using best practices (e.g. linters). I then build the mobile version of the website using the template I choosed from figma.
I then set up the contact form and made sure that I guide the users' experience in a way that helps them fill in the form without frustration. 
Later I applied media queries to make sure that my website displays correctly on mobile, ipad, ipad pro and desktop screens.
I then deployed the website using GitHub Pages and checked the online version of the portfolio and made sure that the page works properly.
Then me and my  partner implemented the mobile menu using recently acquired JavaScript knowledge making sure of the following:
That when the hamburger icon is clicked the menu appears.
When the x-icon is clicked the menu disappears.
When any of the links on the menu are clicked, the menu disappears and you are taken to the corresponding page.
