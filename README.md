# Project Portfolio Mobile Version Skeletun

>In the process of creating this portfolio website, I set up a new repository and prepared it for development using best practices (e.g. linters). I then build the mobile version of the website using the template I choosed from figma.
I then set up the contact form and made sure that I guide the users' experience in a way that helps them fill in the form without frustration. 
Later I applied media queries to make sure that my website displays correctly on mobile, ipad, ipad pro and desktop screens.
I then deployed the website using GitHub Pages and checked the online version of the portfolio and made sure that the page works properly.
Me and my partner then evaluated the website against accessibility best practices and implemented any necessary changes to ensure that the website is accessible.
Then me and my  partner implemented the mobile menu using recently acquired JavaScript knowledge making sure of the following:
That when the hamburger icon is clicked the menu appears.
When the x-icon is clicked the menu disappears.
When any of the links on the menu are clicked, the menu disappears and you are taken to the corresponding page.
Next I implemented a popup window that includes the project details in both desktop and mobile views. In order to do that, I needed to store the information about my projects in a JavaScript object so that when the page was loaded the projects will be created dynamically by javascript.
The final milestone of this portfolio websiteyou was saving the form data in the local storage of the browser. That way when the user reloads the page the data they filled out in the form will be preserved.
